what do i want this game to be..

the character is lost in a house
they need to find a key in a room in order to then get out.



so a character
character needs to be able to hold an item (the key)
door needs to be present
door cannot open without they key (if statements)

something else will be in the way once get that running
maybe needing to find an axe or crowbar to open a different door or barrel? that the key is inside of?

so trying to do a "inventory" may be a bit much for now. what if we just have it be a part of passing a room?
like an attribute of the player that they initially dont have, and then after getting to the prompt for key, they pass?
