Requirements from book:

Here are your requirements:

    Make a different game from the one I made.
    Use more than one file, and use import to use them. Make sure you know what that is.
    Use one class per room and give the classes names that fit their purpose (like GoldRoom, KoiPondRoom).
    Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them. 
        There's plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.


what do i want this game to be..

the character is lost in a house
they need to find a key in a room in order to then get out.


so a character
        this is its own class.
character needs to be able to hold an item (the key) 
        satisfying this with an attribute of the character class.
door needs to be present
    need to make the 'exit room'.
door cannot open without they key (if statements)
    exit should not open unless attribute is true. 

something else will be in the way once get that running

like an attribute of the player that they initially dont have, and then after getting to the prompt for key, they pass?



do i want to do a death thing in this one? while the game he made did have it, i think it may be more fitting as a maze rather than "you can die if you mess up"




Completed:
Use more than one file, and use import to use them. Make sure you know what that is.
    its kinda simple for now, but AM satisfying this requirement. 

idea ice box:

maybe needing to find an axe or crowbar to open a different door or barrel? that the key is inside of?

so trying to do a "inventory" may be a bit much for now. what if we just have it be a part of passing a room?
